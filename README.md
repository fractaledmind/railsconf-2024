# README

This is an app built for demonstration purposes for the [RailsConf 2024 conference](https://railsconf.org) held in Detroit, Michigan on May 7–9, 2024.

It is intended to be run locally in the `RAILS_ENV=production` environment to demonstrate the performance characteristics of a Rails application using SQLite.

## Setup

After cloning the repository, run the `bin/setup` command to install the dependencies and set up the database. It is recommended to run all commands in the `production` environments to allow you to better simulate the application locally:

```sh
RAILS_ENV=production bin/setup
```

## Details

This application runs on Ruby 3.2.1, Rails `main`, and SQLite 3.45.3 (gem version 2.0.1).

It was created using the following command:

```
rails new railsconf-2024 \
  --main \
  --database=sqlite3 \
  --asset-pipeline=propshaft \
  --javascript=esbuild \
  --css=tailwind \
  --skip-jbuilder \
  --skip-action-mailbox \
  --skip-spring
```

So it uses [`propshaft`](https://github.com/rails/propshaft) for asset compilation, [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io) for JavaScript bundling, and [`tailwind`](https://tailwindcss.com) for CSS.

The application is a basic "Hacker News" style app with `User`s, `Post`s, and `Comment`s. The seeds file will create ~100 users, ~1,000 posts, and ~10 comments per post. Every user has the same password: `password`, so you can sign in as any user to test the app.
